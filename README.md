# Project Proposal 
Pico engine is an emerging rules engine used for solving IoT problems. My proposed research is
exploring the pico engine’s capabilities as a behavior based robot platform. The pico engine excels at extracting
logic and state into a single place called persistent compute objects(pico). Pico’s have the qualities needed for
behavior based computing which is reactive persistence. Recent research has demonstrated successful control
of general purpose input/output of a raspberry pi with the pico engine. If the pico engine is able to support
behavioral based logic, meaningful robots will be able to be constructed on top of the pico engine. While this
proposed research is driven for robotics application, a behavioral based Iot system would allow a smart house
to exhibit A.I. while allow integrations of other API’s and A.I.’s.
I propose extending the pico engine to control a robotics simulator like gazebo. Once the pico engine is able
to interface with a simulator, development of behavioral based logic can be driven by simulation.
Research strategies.
1. Read behavior based robotics research publications
2. Integrate pico engine with a simulator
3. Develop strategies for pico behavioral computation
